class QuadTree(object):
    """An implementation of a quad-tree.
 
    This QuadTree started life as a version of [1] but found a life of its own
    when I realised it wasn't doing what I needed. It is intended for static
    geometry, ie, items such as the landscape that don't move.
 
    This implementation inserts items at the current level if they overlap all
    4 sub-quadrants, otherwise it inserts them recursively into the one or two
    sub-quadrants that they overlap.
 
    Items being stored in the tree must possess the following attributes:
 
        left - the x coordinate of the left edge of the item's bounding box.
        top - the y coordinate of the top edge of the item's bounding box.
        right - the x coordinate of the right edge of the item's bounding box.
        bottom - the y coordinate of the bottom edge of the item's bounding box.
 
        where left < right and top < bottom
        
    ...and they must be hashable.
